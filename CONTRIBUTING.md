# How to contribute to SMART Health Card Verifier <!-- omit in toc -->

Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the [project's open source license](LICENSE).

Documentation and wiki pages are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][cc-by].

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Semantic Versioning

SMART Health Card Verifier follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Using conventional commits and proper commit messages üôè will keep our [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)
awesome üöÄ.

### Commits

Here are conventional commit prefixes, and HOW to use them:

The `fix` type indicates that this commit removes a bug in the codebase.<br />
Creating a release with such a commit results in bumping the **patch version**
(0.0.1).

```bash
  git commit -m 'fix: prevent the application from crashing'
```

Creating a `feat` commit means introducing a new feature.<br />
Therefore, it increases the **minor version** (0.1.0).

```bash
  git commit -m 'feat: add the possibility to filter posts'
```

A commit marked as a breaking change üö® results in increasing the **major version**
(1.0.0).<br />
We can create it either by appending the `!` sign, or adding the information
in the footer.

```bash
  git commit -m 'fix!: change the way that the posts are filtered to deal with a bug'
```

Or

```bash
  git commit -m 'feat: add pagination to the posts endpoint' -m 'BREAKING CHANGE: now the result might not contain all posts'
```

We can use many different types of commits:

`test` ‚Äì when modifying existing tests, or adding new ones<br />
`refactor` ‚Äì changing the code in a way that does not fix a bug nor adds features<br />
`docs` ‚Äì modifying the documentation<br />
`chore` ‚Äì routine tasks such as updating dependencies<br />
`build` ‚Äì affecting the way the application builds

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to know how to use emoji's for commit messages.

### Changelog

The [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) is generated using [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version). When we are ready for a release, we will run either one of the commands shown below depending on the changes as stated in the [Commits section](#commits).

```bash
npm run release:patch # git commit -m fix: ...
npm run release:minor # git commit -m feat: ...
npm run release:major # git commit -m feat: ... -m BREAKING CHANGE: ...
```

In short, the package version (e.g. `package.json`) will be bumped up accordingly based on commits. A `changelog` will also be generated/updated based on the commits.

## Branch Organization

Submit all changes directly to the `main` branch. Code may contain additional features, but no breaking changes.

## Bugs

### Known Issues

We are using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn‚Äôt already exist. Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/affinityproject/smart-health-card-verifier/issues) to find one that interests you.

### Reporting New Issues

Report a new issue by submitting one [here](https://github.com/affinityproject/smart-health-card-verifier/issues). Please ensure you provide necessary details for us to understand and replicate the issue.

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don‚Äôt accidentally duplicate your effort.

## Sending a Pull Request

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/affinityproject/smart-health-card-verifier) and create a new branch from `main`
2. Install dependencies - more details can be found in [README.md](./README.md). Do note the project uses `npx npm-force-resolutions` ([link to repo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-force-resolutions), equivalent to [yarn resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/).
3. Make changes and test
4. Ensure you code is formtted with our [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) config.
5. Submit Pull Request with comprehensive description of changes

## Documentation
If you feel you need to add some documentation with or without examples, place these under [./docs](./docs)) folder in MarkDown format.
