# How to contribute to SMART Health Card Verifier <!-- omit in toc -->

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Semantic Versioning

SMART Health Card Verifier follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Using conventional commits and proper commit messages üôè will keep our [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)
awesome üöÄ.

Here are conventional commit prefixes, and HOW to use them:

The `fix` type indicates that this commit removes a bug in the codebase.<br />
Creating a release with such a commit results in bumping the **patch version**
(0.0.1).

```bash
  git commit -m 'fix: prevent the application from crashing'
```

Creating a `feat` commit means introducing a new feature.<br />
Therefore, it increases the **minor version** (0.1.0).

```bash
  git commit -m 'feat: add the possibility to filter posts'
```

A commit marked as a breaking change üö® results in increasing the **major version**
(1.0.0).<br />
We can create it either by appending the `!` sign, or adding the information
in the footer.

```bash
  git commit -m 'fix!: change the way that the posts are filtered to deal with a bug'
```

Or

```bash
  git commit -m 'feat: add pagination to the posts endpoint' -m 'BREAKING CHANGE: now the result might not contain all posts'
```

We can use many different types of commits:

`test` ‚Äì when modifying existing tests, or adding new ones<br />
`refactor` ‚Äì changing the code in a way that does not fix a bug nor adds features<br />
`docs` ‚Äì modifying the documentation<br />
`chore` ‚Äì routine tasks such as updating dependencies<br />
`build` ‚Äì affecting the way the application builds

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide]https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to know how to use emoji's for commit messages.
