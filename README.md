## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Node **v14.17.X** (LTS/fermium)

### Global dependencies

```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Clone the repository

```bash
  git clone git@gitlab.com:st-experiments/health-card-verifier-mobile.git
```

### Install project required dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

### Expo Go

Expo Go allows to run the project directly on your mobile device.
Follow [these](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/#2-expo-go-app-for-ios-and)
instructions to install Expo Go on your mobile phone.

### Run application locally

```bash
  npm start
```

Expo will open an application in the default browser with a QR code, that should
be scanned with your mobile device and open the application with Expo Go.

### Making commits

Using conventional commits and proper commit messages üôè will keep our [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)
awesome üöÄ.

Here are conventional commit prefixes, and HOW to use them:

The `fix` type indicates that this commit removes a bug in the codebase.<br />
Creating a release with such a commit results in bumping the **patch version**
(0.0.1).

```bash
  git commit -m 'fix: prevent the application from crashing'
```

Creating a `feat` commit means introducing a new feature.<br />
Therefore, it increases the **minor version** (0.1.0).

```bash
  git commit -m 'feat: add the possibility to filter posts'
```

A commit marked as a breaking change üö® results in increasing the **major version**
(1.0.0).<br />
We can create it either by appending the `!` sign, or adding the information
in the footer.

```bash
  git commit -m 'fix!: change the way that the posts are filtered to deal with a bug'
```

Or

```bash
  git commit -m 'feat: add pagination to the posts endpoint' -m 'BREAKING CHANGE: now the result might not contain all posts'
```

We can use many different types of commits:

`test` ‚Äì when modifying existing tests, or adding new ones<br />
`refactor` ‚Äì changing the code in a way that does not fix a bug nor adds features<br />
`docs` ‚Äì modifying the documentation<br />
`chore` ‚Äì routine tasks such as updating dependencies<br />
`build` ‚Äì affecting the way the application builds

## Release

[Standard Version](https://github.com/expo-community/standard-version-expo#readme)
is used to automate the versioning of the project‚ùóÔ∏è- to update the Expo
manifest automatically ü§ñ.

To update the _application version_, Android _versionCode_ and iOS _buildNumber_
run one of the commands below.

#### Patch version update

WHEN: everytime except of breaking changes or new feature introduction

```bash
  npm run release:patch
```

#### Minor version update

WHEN: on adding new feature

```bash
  npm run release:minor
```

#### Major version update

WHEN: on breaking changes

```bash
  npm run release:major
```

## Publish application

Application is published to App Store and Google Play via Bitrise as a part of CI/CD
on merge/commit into the `main` branch.
